          IEEE AP-MTT societyâ€™s field of interest includes analysis, design,
          development, measurement, and testing; radiation, radio propagation,
          and the interaction of electromagnetic waves with discrete and
          continuous media; and applications and systems pertinent to antennas,
          propagation, and sensing, such as applied optics, antenna signal
          processing and control, radio astronomy, and propagation and radiation
          aspects of terrestrial and space-based communication, including
          wireless, mobile, satellite, and telecommunications. The society
          promotes the advancement of microwave theory and its applications,
          including RF, microwave, millimetre-wave, and terahertz technologies.
